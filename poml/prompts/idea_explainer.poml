## Example Output

### Input
**Title:** User Import Error Prevention  
**Description:** Enhanced validation for user data imports to prevent format mismatches

### Output
```markdown
**[Idea] - User Import Error Prevention**

**Overview of the Idea**  
This enhancement adds automatic validation to user data imports, preventing incorrectly formatted files from corrupting the database by checking file structure before processing.

**Plain English Explanation**
When you upload a spreadsheet of user information to a system, the computer needs the columns to be in a specific order with specific names. This idea adds a "gatekeeper" that checks your file before importing it. If your spreadsheet doesn't match what the system expects, it tells you exactly what's wrong instead of importing bad data that could cause problems later.

**Examples**
1. *HR Department Scenario:* An HR manager tries to upload employee data with a column labeled "Email" instead of "Email Address". The system catches this and shows a message: "Column 'Email Address' expected but 'Email' found."

2. *School Registration:* A school administrator downloads last year's template but the system now requires a new "Emergency Contact" field. When uploading, they're notified of the missing column and can download the updated template.

**Step-by-Step Explanation**
1. User initiates data import by selecting their file
2. System reads the file headers (column names)
3. Headers are compared against the required template structure
4. If headers match exactly, import proceeds
5. If mismatch detected, system blocks import and generates specific error message
6. User receives actionable feedback about what needs correction
7. System provides link to download current template
8. User corrects file and re-attempts import
```
