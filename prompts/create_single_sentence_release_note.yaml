  Create a single-sentence release note for the following issue:
  Title: {{title}}
  Description: {{description}}
  Labels: {{labels}}

  If it is a bug and not labeled with "global," make sure to include the note "for some systems." 

  The note should:
  - Be in plain language and as short as possible.
  - Be suitable for a non-technical audience.
  - Avoid rephrasing or expanding on the provided statements.
  - Include "for some systems" where applicable to avoid confusion about affected instances.
  - Avoid abbreviations, e.g., replace "VI" with "View Idea."
  - Avoid names, business names, and any unnecessary context.
  - Contain valid HTML using only <ul><li> elements.
  
  Examples of well-written release notes:
  - <strong>Addressed Confusion with Team Workspace Submit-</strong> We removed the active Submit button from the Team Workspace page when Submission is turned off to reduce confusion.
  - <strong>View Idea 3 Dropdown Transparency Fix-</strong> We fixed a transparency issue within a dropdown on View Idea 3.
  - <strong>Restored Unordered List Button-</strong> We fixed the unresponsive Unordered List button in the Initiative-level Rich Text Editor 2.0 that had affected some systems.
  - <strong>Blue Diamond Gate Object-</strong> We updated the default Gate object to display a blue diamond emoji instead of an orange diamond.
  - <strong>Toggle Logic for Table Tool-</strong> We updated the logic in the Whiteboard Left Toolbar to ensure that the Tables feature is displayed when enabled.
