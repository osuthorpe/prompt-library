      "Query Results: Here are some ideas related to hackathons that have been submitted to the platform:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Updating Hackathon Support Pages**:\n",
      "   - **Submitted by Michael Lutjen on 09/22/2023**: This idea focuses on updating the Hackathon support pages to reflect new branding, including name changes from \"Hack\" to \"Hackathon\" and updating orange icons to a red design. This has been implemented, indicating the changes have been made.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Updating References in Product**:\n",
      "   - **Submitted by Michael Lutjen on 09/22/2023**: Similar to the support pages update, this idea suggests reflecting branding updates in the product itself by changing references from \"Hack\" to \"Hackathon\" and updating color schemes. This idea has also been implemented.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Renaming Steps in Hackathon Pipeline**:\n",
      "   - **Submitted by Veronika Vacek on 06/24/2024**: Proposes renaming the first step in the hackathon process from \"Initial Submission\" to \"Incubate\" to better align with the hackathon's goal of building out ideas and team development. This is a new submission and has not been implemented yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Specific Hackathon Data Exports**:\n",
      "   - **Submitted by Veronika Vacek on 12/06/2024**: Suggests adding new export options for hackathons, including data fields for participants attached to multiple pitches and pitches with fewer participants than required. This is a new submission.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Consistency in Hackathon App Logo**:\n",
      "   - **Submitted by Michelle Brown on 07/22/2024**: Proposes achieving consistency across hackathon app logos and icons across various software and assets to ensure a cohesive look. This is a new submission.\n",
      "\n",
      "These ideas primarily focus on updating branding and improving the hackathon participant and organizer experience through design consistency and enhanced data handling. If you need more details about these submissions or other aspects of hackathons, feel free to ask!\n"
